    <p>In one of the most frequently quoted passages in the history of emotion research, William James (1884, 189ff.) announces that emotions occur when the perception of an exciting fact causes a collection of bodily changes, and “our feeling of the same changes as they occur IS the emotion.” The same idea occurred to Carl Lange (1885) around the same time. These authors were not the first to draw a link between the emotions and the body. Indeed, this had been a central theme of Descartes’s exquisite opus The Passions of the Soul.</p>
